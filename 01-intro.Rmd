# Introduction {#intro}

The WDFW Fish Program currently uses [iFormBuilder](https://www.zerionsoftware.com/iformbuilder/) as a platform for building and deploying mobile forms. Although there are numerous alternative mobile platforms, both commercial and open-source, among the benefits of iFormBuilder are an easy-to-use form building application, a fairly good system for syncing between forms and devices, and an excellent application programming interface (API). The [API](http://docs.iformbuilder.apiary.io/#) is particulary useful, as it allows us to automate many of the most burdensome aspects of building forms and managing data flows.

## Why mobile forms?

### Trade-offs

Mobile electronic forms provide a number of advantages over paper forms, but as always, there are trade-offs. For seasoned surveyors, the field notebook has long proven to be a simple and effective tool to jot down observations. Short-hand comments and codes have been developed that enable recording a great deal of information succinctly and quickly. Switching to mobile forms *can* slow down data entry in the field, at least initially. This can be frustrating when you have a large number of streams to survey, limited staff, or short windows of opportunity between fall and winter storms to get those surveys completed. 

Avoiding unnecessary slowdowns and keeping your surveyors happy is important. This is also the main reason for making sure the structure of mobile forms is kept as simple as possible. Minimizing the number of subforms can speed up data entry in the field. Conditionally hiding data elements until they are truly needed keep forms streamlined and free of unneeded clutter. But regardless of how simple the form, there will still be some pain to begin with. That pain will go away in time, especially as the benefits of using mobile forms become more apparent.

If your survey protocols are relatively simple, and you are only interested in recording a few core data elements, the benefits of mobile survey forms may not be immediately apparent. It is only when the entire process of capturing, recording, transcribing, proofing, analyzing data, and finally, *using* the data to calculate population estimates is all taken into account that the true efficiencies become compelling. 

### Automated, integrated, data capture

Mobile forms allow capturing data using a variety of sensors quickly and accurately. Those data are then fully integrated with all your other observations. A good example is location data. It can often be useful to map locations of salmon redds to understand density over time, or see how changes in habitat have affected populations in a particular section of a creek or river. Using a typical combination of field notebook and a separate GPS unit, considerable work is required to download, proof, and integrate the location data with the field notebook data. Both the field notebook data and GPS data needs to be separately entered, proofed, and finally combined. Mobile devices include integrated GPS, and output integrated data. There is no need for manually combining disparate sets of data after the survey. 

### Enter once

Mobile forms avoid the need to transcribe data from a field notebook or write-in-the-rain datasheets to electronic format. Data only needs to be entered once. This avoids common transcription errors that can often be notoriously hard to spot. After the *Done* button has been clicked on the mobile device, the data can then be automatically written to our corporate database with no additional effort on the part of the surveyor or supervisor. After the data has been written to the central database it can be inspected, edited if needed, and exported for reports or analysis. 

### Validation

Another advantage of mobile forms is data integrity. Common errors can be automatically detected while still in the field by adding validation code directly into your forms. An unusual value can be flagged and the surveyor immediately asked to verify the suspect value before submitting. Validation code can be as simple or elaborate as needed. It is normal to add additional validation code after you launch a mobile form and you start to notice where errors tend to occur. An especially useful feature of mobile forms is that you can add validation or other features as you progress through the season. Your surveyors then just need to sync their forms to get the lastest updates. 

### Reporting

For biologists, an added bonus of mobile forms is a clean set of data that is housed in a predictable format, and securely backed up. With proper validation on the front-end, data transmitted from mobile form to back-end database is immediately available for reporting and analysis. Clean data, organized in a consistent format can make it easier to produce population estimates and reports.


## API

As mentioned earlier, a major benefit of using the iFormBuilder platform for building and deploying mobile forms is the application programming interface, or API. An API is simply a set of protocols that allows computers to talk to one another. One case where the API can avoid a great deal of pain is in constructing large filtered option lists. The prime example for spawning ground surveys are the drop-down pick-lists for survey start and stop points along a given stream. Lists with thousands of elements can be constructed and uploaded to the iFormBuilder cloud in seconds. The [iformr](https://github.com/arestrom/iformr) package provides a set of functions that allows for using [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) scripts to automate many of these types of tasks. Instructions for how to get started can be found in package [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arestrom/iformr).

## Profiles

Since the source code for this manual is hosted on a public website, I will not go into detail on setting up devices, assigning AppleIDs, Google Play store accounts, or connecting to the WDFW iFormBuider account. The only prerequiste that needs to be stressed here is that you will want to get a separate iFormBuilder **Profile** set up for your workgroup. The main benefit is that it keeps your forms and option lists segregated from other groups, and makes it less likely you will lose data because someone accidentally edited your form...or deleted an option list. Contact me if you need help to get this set up.

## Useful tips

### Searching for help

There is a great deal of information available at the iFormBuilder website for learning how to build forms. This includes an extensive list of videos. Unfortunately, that information is not always well organized. You can often get better results doing your own internet search and prefacing a general search term such as *parse location* with *iformbuilder*, rather than using iFormBuilder's help pages. That said, the [Customer Success Center](https://iformbuilder.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) is still a good place to start. If you have not already done so, watch the [Art of Form Building](https://www.zerionsoftware.com/recording/form-builder-101-may-2016/) video for an introduction to best practices. 

At some point you will need to write simple JavaScript code. This is especially important when you want to create conditional logic to hide or show a data element, validate data, or sum up a set of counts. My favorite site for help with JavaScript is [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). If you need to do something more complex, you will usually find that someone has already written a function to accomplish exactly what you want. Try searching on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript). In addition, there is a selection of commonly used JavaScript functions located in the appendix section of this manual.

### Data column names

When adding new data elements to your form keep in mind that the `data_column` names must be what is termed *database friendly*. They must all be in lower case, and you cannot use compound words, such as `redd count` without first tying the words together using an underscore. For example, `redd_count`. There is also a long list of [reserved words](https://iformbuilder.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201698530-Reserved-Words-What-words-cannot-be-used-as-data-column-names-) that you cannot use for `data_column` names. These can be downloaded from the link above. 

### Option lists

Always remember that option lists can be shared among different forms. This means that whenever you edit an option lists you are changing options for all forms that share the list. This can cause severe problems with other mobile forms in your profile if you are not careful. 

### Save often

When building forms, remember to **Save** frequently. Best practice is to get into the habit of clicking the save icon in the upper right-hand corner of the form builder interface every time you make a change. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/actions.png")
```

Few things are more annoying than to make a series of changes to a form, then later realize that all your work has dissapeared because you forgot to save. 

## Conventions

This manual is meant to be an interactive resource for those learning to build mobile forms using the iFormBuilder platform. As such, there are numerous links to outside resources included. These are highlighted in blue. For example: [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). 

You will also find snippets of code that can be copied and pasted directly from this manual to your forms. These are entered to code blocks such as:

```{js, eval = FALSE}
if(species == 3 && redd_status == 0) {"Yes"} else {"No"}
```

Code blocks are also used to highlight text, code, or numbers that you enter directly into the form builder web application when designing forms. For example: `ZCDisplayValue_stream`, or the number `-1`, or data column names such as `survey_method`. 

Screenshots are liberally included to help identify where commands are located in the form builder application. **Bold** text is used to bring attention to items of particular importance, such as **Save often**. 

Finally, suggestions are always welcome on how to improve this manual. If you find errors, discover cases where conventions are not followed, locate additional outside resources that should be linked, or identify places where additional screenshots would be helpful, please let me know. You can file issues or contribute your suggestions at the project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arestrom/mf4ss).
